## Creators Note
This is an educational project, and has not been properly battle tested to be used in a production environment.

# Testing
Their is a basic testing suite included in the ```parser_test.go``` file, please feel free to add your own cases to exand it's reach!

# Documentation
As this project is still in an early stage of development I am reluctant to place the *rapidly* changing docmentation in the lime-light and say that they are official. However, if you are exceptionally curious you may view the doc.go file, or http://godoc.org/pkg/github.com/paked/down to see a live working copy that is by no means finished.
