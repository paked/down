# Down
Down implements a strict subset of the Markdown syntax aimed to reduce ambiguity, improve readability and speed up parse time.

# Documentation
As this project is still in an early stage of development I am reluctant to place the *rapidly* changing docmentation in the lime-light and say that they are official. However, if you are exceptionally curious you may view the doc.go file, or http://godoc.org/pkg/github.com/paked/down to see a live working copy that is by no means finished.

## Creators Note
Most of the features are in place, however everything is incredibly buggy (also notice the lack of real testing...) Hopefully I will rectify both of these features in the near feature.
